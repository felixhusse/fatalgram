      <h1 class="fatalgram-heading">Welcome to fatalgram</h1>
      <p class="lead text-muted">
        Ever wondered how Google, Meta & Apple are identifying/tagging persons in your photos? So I thought the best way to
        understand how it works is trying to copy it. This is my try. Fatalgram allows you to:</p>
        <ul class="lead text-muted">
          <li>Upload a photo</li>
          <li>detect faces in photos</li>
          <li>identify persons</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead text-muted">
          The used technologies are:
        </p>
        <ul class="lead text-muted">
          <li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, as my web framework</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition">face recognition</a> as my main part for the photo recongnition</li>
          <li><a href="https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html">Celery</a>, as my task scheduler for async image processing</li>
          <li><a href="https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Cookiecutter Django</a>, as my starting template</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, as my infrastructure base</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead text-muted">
          And many more "nifty swifty libraries", which are provided by a great open source community.
